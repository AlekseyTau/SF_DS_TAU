### What case are we solving?
Needed to create a program, that guesses the guessed number using the minimal attempts.

**The rules of contest**
- The computer is picking a number in a range from 1 to 100 and we have to guess it. By "guess" we understand to write a program that will guess the number.
- The algorythm takes into account information was the random number bigger or smaller than the needed one.

**The metrics of quality**
Results are judged by average ammoutnt of attempts in 1000 repeats.

**What's practicing**
Learning how to write good code on Python.
